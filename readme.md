#How to use
    
To use just run:
```
ruby service_charge_reminder.rb

```
the date will be automatically set for today.

To select a date just enter
```
ruby service_charge_reminder.rb <year> <month> <day>

the day argument isn't necessary but without it the date will be set to the beginning of the month.
